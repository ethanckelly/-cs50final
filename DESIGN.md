Our project endeavored to create a music review website (similar to Rotten Tomatoes) that allowed users to view critic reviews of albums and rate and review those albums as well. Our first step was finding data to create a database that we could traverse with SQL. To do this, we downloaded two datasets of music reviews from Kaggle: one of reviews by Anthony Fantano (a prominent music reviewer on Youtube) and one of reviews from Metacritic. If we had had more time, we would have looked for other critic databases as well to aggregate into our project. These databases were combined imported into our albums.db as well as tables for the users and the reviews.
